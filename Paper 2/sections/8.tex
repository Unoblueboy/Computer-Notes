\subsection{Individual (Moral), Social (Ethical), Legal and Cultural Issues and Opportunities}
  \noindent
  \marginnote{3.8.1}Here, we define a moral issue as an issue that concerns our personal concepts about what is right and what is wrong, whereas ethical issues are about what society finds right and wrong. Development in technology has led to many people worrying about use and misuse of data:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
    \item Personal privacy
    \item Data security
    \item Misuse of Data
    \item Governmental Monitoring
    \item Online Profile
    \item Profiling
  \end{itemize}
  There are also many other issues associated with computer science:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
    \item Unauthorised access
    \item Unauthorised use of software
    \item Inappropriate behaviour
    \item Inappropriate Content
    \item Freedom of Speech
    \item Unemployment
    \item Access to the internet
  \end{itemize}
  When using a computer as part of an institution, you will normally have to agree to a code of conduct. The British Computer Society (BSC) has produced a code of conduct that guide organisations on the ethical use of computer systems in general. Any breaches in the code can't be punished legally but could lead to dismissal of an employee or asking a student to leave their school. The general principle are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
    \item Always operate in the interest of the public
    \item Have a duty to the institution you represent
    \item Have a duty to the profession
    \item Maintain professional competence and integrity
  \end{itemize}
  For this course you may be ask questions on how laws manage the use of computers, the specification is super vague so they can basically ask you about anything, so here's a bunch of laws you may need to know:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
    \item Data Protection Act
      \subitem This law states that (with a few exceptions) any person or organisation storing personal data must register with the Information Comissioner, and that data subjects have the right to know what data are stored about them by any particular individual or organisation.
    \item Freedom of Information Act
      \subitem This gives general rights of access to information held by public authorities such as hospitals, doctors, dentists, the police, schools and colleges.
    \item Computer Misuse Act
      \subitem This was introduced to prevent hacking (data misuse) and deals with three specific offences: unauthorised access to computer programs or data, unauthorised access with further criminal intent, unauthorised modification of computer material.
    \item Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act
      \subitem This talks about the powers the government have when investigating and have two parts that relate to computing (out of 5 parts), part one which relates to interception of communication, and part three which relates to investigation of encrypted data.
    \item Copyright, Designs and Patents Act
      \subitem This gives certain rights to the creators of certain kinds of material allowing them control over the way in which the material is used, covering the copying, adapting and renting of materials.
      \subitem Copyright can be dealt with in a few ways, two techniques are: Digital Rights Management (DRM) which uses access control software to limit what the user can do, and Licensing where the user has to use some sort of paper or digital proof to be able to use a piece of software.
    \item Official Secrets Act
      \subitem  Prevents the disclosure of government data relating to national security
    \item Defamation Act
      \subitem Prevents people from making untrue statements about others which will lead to their reputation being damaged
    \item Obscene Publications Act and the Protection of Children Act
      \subitem Prevent people from disseminating pornographic or violent images
    \item Health and Safety Regulations
      \subitem Provides regulations on the correct use of screens and on how to keep employees safe in general
    \item Equality Act
      \subitem Illegal to discriminate against anyone because of their age, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, disability, or age.
  \end{itemize}
  Here are some cultural issues that could possibly be talked about:
  \begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0em}
    \item Over-use of data: Too dependant on data
    \item Invasive technologies: Data collected without consent
    \item Over-reliance on computers: Computer systems failing may lead to loss of lives
    \item Over-reliance on technology companies: Some companies have large internet presence
    \item Governmental monitoring: Beliefs that the government may track everything we do
    \item Globalisation: We can be influenced by other countries and cultures
  \end{itemize}
